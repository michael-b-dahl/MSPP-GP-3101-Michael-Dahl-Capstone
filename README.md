# MSPP-GP-3101-Michael-Dahl-Capstone
My final project for the 2021-2022 NYU Wagner MSPP Program.

The following code is an analysis into the effect of NYC's Health Policy that increased the Minimum Legal Age (MLA) to purchase nicotine products from 18 to 21.
If you're interested in reading my analysis and thoughts, please see my Medium article... Link:

In order to run the code above, please utilize the "projectCode" file and run it in the current downloadable version of R (https://cran.r-project.org/). 
Relevant packages should be installed and called via the "library" code included in the first handful of lines within the ProjectCode. 
Additional analysis was completed in DataWrapper (https://app.datawrapper.de/) and QGIS (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). All necessary files, datasets, and codebooks
should be included in this GitHub Repository. 

For any questions regarding the code, please email mbd9413@nyu.edu. Thank you! Comments welcome.

Big thank you to Lucy Block and Sam Rabiyah for their assistance throughout my final course at NYU Wagner. Also, a big thank you to the greatest cohort of 
bright, motivated, intelligent, and compassionate people I've ever met.
